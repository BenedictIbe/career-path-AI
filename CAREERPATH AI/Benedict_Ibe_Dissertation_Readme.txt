Attached below are notebooks containing python codes for a Career path optimizer Dissertation research:

Extension: .ipynb

Environment: The Codes were constructed and deployed on a microsoft azure analytics notebook, which is native and supports mainly pyspark codes. Therefore the codes and dataframes are pyspark codes.

CareerPathOptimizer: Contains the codes for the text classification of job title (Job title normalization), Clustering analysis, Correlation analysis, Recommender system (Filtration method)

EDA_CareerPath: Contains codes for exploring the datasets to generate more insights and better understanding of the struch=ture of the datasets

Cluster Analysis: Contains codes used to build and run K-Means clustering on the job title

Cosine_Similsarity_Recommender_System: Contains Codes used to build and deploy the content based filtration technique (Cosine Similarity) approach on the datasets.
